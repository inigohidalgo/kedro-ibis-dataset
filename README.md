Connector to load data from SQL tables into [Kedro](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro) pipelines using [Ibis](https://github.com/ibis-project/ibis) tables.
This allows for connecting to databases and constructing queries dynamically using Kedro's node-pipeline framework to construct Ibis expressions.
